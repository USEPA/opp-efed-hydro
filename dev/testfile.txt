Introduction

This national dataset was built from the NHDPlusV21 data.

A complete understanding of the content of this dataset, how to use the data, how to interpret the data, and the relationships between the feature classes, can be obtained from the NHDPlusV21 User Guide available here:
https://s3.amazonaws.com/nhdplus/NHDPlusV21/Documentation/NHDPlusV2_User _Guide.pdf

Not all NHDPlusV21 feature classes and tables are included in this dataset.  No NHDPlusV21 raster components are included.

The NHDPlusV21 data that is included has been reformatted to reduce the number of feature classes and tables as follows:
●	PlusFlowlineVAA, HWnodearea, ElevSmooth, CumulativeArea, FeatureureIDGridCode, PlusFlowlineLakeMorphology, and EROM Mean Annual Flow attributes are collapsed onto NHDFlowline.
●	Simplified catchments and detailed catchments are both included as separate feature classes.
●	Non-redundant BurnWaterbody and PlusWaterbodyLakeMorphology attributes were collapsed into NHDWaterbody and NHDArea.
●	Gages were deleted from NHDPoint.
●	Dams were deleted from NHDPoint, NHDLine, NHDArea.
●	NHDxxxxxEventFC feature classes were deleted.
●	EROM and EROMQA fields were renamed to remove "0001".
●	All the Version Text file names are in a single table.
●	HUC2, HUC4, and HUC6 fields were added to the National WBD snapshot.
●	Redundant fields were removed, as needed.

DivFracMP (table)

Description:   Contains specifications about the fraction of a cumulative attribute to be routed through each path in a divergence. The ComIDs in this table represent NHDFlowline surface water features, found in the PlusFlow table, that form a network divergence (i.e. a flow split). All the paths in a given divergence are identified in this table by a unique NodeNumber.

PlusFlowlineVAA.Divergence always follows the named stream path. When stream name is used to determine the main path in a divergence, the entries in the DivFracMP table do not override the main path designation in the Divergence flag in PlusFlowlineVAA. When stream name does not determine the main path, then values in DivFracMP will establish the value in PlusFlowlineVAA.Divergence.

All divergences are represented in this table. If DivFracMP values are specified, they are used in the divergence routing method of all NHDPlus accumulated attributes, such as drainage area. Divergences where no information is known about the fractional split have DivFracMP.DivFrac = -9998 for all paths in the divergence. In this case, the Divergence Routing method uses the PlusFlowlineVAA.Divergence field and routes a fraction of 1 to the main path (i.e. Divergence = 1) and a fraction of 0 to all other paths (i.e. Divergence = 2). The impact of using DivFracMP in the Divergence Routing method is discussed in section “Understanding and Using NHDPlusV2”.

When not set to -9998, the sum of the DivFrac values for all paths in a divergence (i.e. all records with the same NodeNumber) must equal 1.

Description:  A table that describes flowing and non-flowing connections between NHDFlowline features.

Note: Native NHD contains a flow table called NHDFlow.  NHDFlow contains only geometric connections between NHDFlowline features. PlusFlow, on the other hand, includes non-geometric and geometric connections.  Non-geometric connections are used to represent situations such as return flows along an international border and underground connections in karst topography.
